**Duration** - 3 days

**My Role** - Mobile Developer

**My Team** Myself

## Motivation

I have a mobile application developed using WeChat Mini Program but it's not common in the US. React Native is right now the most popular framework for developing mobile apps. So I want to use react native to build a small mobile application, see how it works.

## Tech Stack
**Front-End** - React Native, Tailwind CSS,

**Api** - Google Maps API,(Places API, Distance Matrix API, Directions API)

**State Management** - Redux Toolkit

## Challenges

* Learn how the Google Map Api works

* Get familar with Tailwind CSS (I love it!)


## Takeaways

* The performance of React Native is so must better then WeChat Mini Programs.
