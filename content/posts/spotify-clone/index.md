## Tech Stack
**Front-End** - Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS,

**Authentication** - NextAuth.js

**Api** - Spotify Web Api

**State Management** - Recoil.js

## Challenges

**|** Use NextAuth.js to ask for user's authorization and perform user authentication

**|** Use JWT in nextauth's callback functions to increase security

**|** Learn how the Spotify Web Api works

**|** Learn how Server-Side rendering works

## Takeaways 

Compared to React.js, Next.js is so much more powerful, like it's born for full-stack!

Recoil is more sematically readable then Redux, probably ~~**never**~~ gonna use Redux again, even thought they published Redux Tookit

Next goal is to build a full-stack application using Next.js to learn how to use Next backend to manage database and maintain code
