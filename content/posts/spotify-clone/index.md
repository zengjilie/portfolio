**Duration** - 3 day

**My Role** - Front-End Developer

**My Team** Myself

### [Demon Video](https://youtu.be/tM8pquJBciE)

## Motivation

Authorization is so popular in lots of applications. It's an important step to build a big social app project. So I want to learn this. I heard Next.js is a production-ready full-stack framework, so I want to learn that too.

## Tech Stack
**Front-End** - Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS,

**Authentication** - NextAuth.js

**Api** - Spotify Web Api

**State Management** - Recoil.js

## Challenges

* Use NextAuth.js to ask for user's authorization and perform user authentication

* Use JWT in nextauth's callback functions to increase security

* Learn how the Spotify Web Api works

* Learn how Server-Side rendering works

* Deploy website to Vercel and set environmental variables

## Takeaways 

* Next.js is so powerful, gonna use it to build a full-stack project next time 

* Recoil is sematically more readable then Redux, probably ~~**never**~~ gonna use Redux again
