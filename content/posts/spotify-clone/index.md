**Duration** - 3 days

**My Role** - Front End Developer

### [Demon Video](https://youtu.be/tM8pquJBciE)
### [Repo](https://github.com/zengjilie/spotify-clone)
<!-- ## Motivation

Authorization is so popular in lots of applications. It's an important step to build a big social app project. So I want to learn this. I heard Next.js is a production-ready full-stack framework, so I want to learn that too. -->

## Tech Stack
**Front-End** - NextJS, ReactJS, Tailwind CSS,

**Authentication** - NextAuthJS

**Api** - Spotify Web Api

**State Management** - RecoilJS

<!-- ## Challenges

* Use NextAuth.js to ask for user's authorization and perform user authentication

* Use JWT in nextauth's callback functions to increase security

* Learn how the Spotify Web Api works

* Learn how Server-Side rendering works

* Deploy website to Vercel and set environmental variables -->

<!-- ## Takeaways 

* Next.js is so powerful, gonna use it to build a full-stack project next time 

* Recoil is sematically more readable then Redux, probably ~~**never**~~ gonna use Redux again -->
