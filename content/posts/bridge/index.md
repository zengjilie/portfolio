## Problem 

In this project, we focused on elderly life. Since we are a team, we started by brainstorming and HMWs. Later, we all decided on an innovative problem, which is the **senior immigrants' acculturation**.

## User Rsearch

We conducted 6 offline interviews with seniors who happened to have international immigration or domestic migration experiences (It’s really hard to find people with this kind of experience who happens to be a senior). Based on our interviews, we used the user spectrum to categories their behavior patterns and lifestyles.

## Persona

We decided to use A's lifestyles and behavior patterns and created a persona for type A users. Her name is Mary(美钰).

## Empathy Mapping

To better empathize with Mary, we created an empathy map for her.

## Value Proposition Canvas

Value proposition canvas is a very good tool for teams to brainstorm ideas and at the same time keep everyone aligned with the user.
