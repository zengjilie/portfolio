## Problem

Campus commute has always been a problem for Chinese students, especially when some of the Chinese universities started to expand their campus area or merge with another nearby university. In this project, I focus on transportation tools of college students aiming to design a new concept to solve this problem.

## Field Study
I did a field study on how college students use campus transportations like shared bicycles. Besides, I also noticed that college students use food delivery services a lot, so there are some outside delivery riders on the campus too.

## Stakeholder Analysis
I identified the 4 most important stakeholders inside the campus traffic ecosystem

## Stakeholder Relationship
Understanding their conflicts of interest can help me identify the most important problem to solve.
