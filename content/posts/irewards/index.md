**Duration** - 3 months

**My Role** - UI/UX Designer

**My Team** - 2 developers, 1 UX researcher, 1 PR
### [卡伯(Cardbo)](https://page.line.me/089clhec)

### [Our Team](https://cep.ntu.edu.tw/2019/12/30/cep12th-carbo/)

{{< admonition tip "Disclaimer" true>}}
**iRewards** is my latter redesigned version of Cardbo(卡伯), which uses the same research results, not the published version on Line. Our beta version was... too shabby

## Tech Stack
**Design** - Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop

## Problem 

In Taiwan, people love using credit cards. One may have 6-15 credit cards because each has a different reward policy. For those users, it may be a headache to them when choosing which credit card to pay for stuff. So our product aims to solve this problem.

## User Research

To better find users' pain points, we collected quantitative data from 264 people using **SurveyCake**, and interviewed 15 people online to gather qualitative data. Here are some key findings.

## Persona

Based on the users' data we collected, there are two types of users. The **Petty Bourgeoisie** and the **Credit Card Enthusiast**. We created personas for them to better understand their lifestyles and behavior patterns.

## Ideation
This is my own part of ideation.

## Wireframe
I prefer creating wireframes directly in photoshop using my drawing tablet because drawing gives me more freedom than pulling boxes inside Figma.

## Information Architecture

Based on the refined version of wireframes, I built the information architecture. Information architecture is a very good way to connect with developers because it shows the whole structure of the application, so developers can start arranging some basic components and logic.

## UI Specs

Here is my favorite design part.

## Prototype
### [Give it a try!](https://xd.adobe.com/view/5bb23f2e-6dce-4c09-b14e-dc102236afd1-0ee1/screen/3f7115a1-f55a-455b-94d1-dc7fd4437024)

## Usability Test 

I invited 3 tester to test this app. Here are the results.

## Takeaways
<!--  -->
* Don't ask questions continuously during user interviews
* Give users some thing to try or play with 
* Turn WHY questions into WHAT questions
