## Who I am 
Howdy! I'm Alex üëã

After learning how to design products for four years, I decided to change my career to software development because I want to make my designs into a reality. Having the ability to create a product, share it with the world, and use it to help those in need gives my life meaning. I have been coding for 2 years now and if you were to ask me what I learned from this journey, it is to ‚Äúkeep pushing, never settle‚Äù
