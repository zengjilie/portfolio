## What I'm doing
Howdy! I'am Alex ðŸ‘‹

After learning how to design products for 4 years, I decided to change my career to software development because I want to make my design come true. The ability to build a product, let people use it, and solve people's problems gives me so much more fulfillment than anything else. Now I have been coding for 2 years. If you ask me what I learned from this journey, that is "keep pushing, and never settle"! ðŸ’»
